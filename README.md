# remote-controlled-Robotic-arm
Remote Controlled Robotic Arm is  3D printed 6 axis or d DOF arm. the robot is made from an arduino nano microcontroller 
using arduino IDE for programming. the arm is capable of moving each joint in a 180 dgree and able to pick up object around 100g. 
the following contains the 3D parts that was designed using solid works, containing the screws type of screws and how to assemble it.
an arduino is not ncessery to acutate the robot any other development board would work providing you could program it.

parts used:
-arduino nano development board
-pca9685 driver
-HC-05 bluetooth module
